I have been programming for about 6 years and would like to make it my job. I enjoy creating and solving problems because nothing else gives you that special feeling of success! I have thought myself HTML5, Python, Shell Script and Linux, as well as a lot of different tools and programs. There is nothing better than to create something new and experiment with new stuff, I'm constantly growing and I enjoy learning about new things.</subtitle></feed>
