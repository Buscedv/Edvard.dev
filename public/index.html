			<strong>I enjoy learning about new things and finding creative solutions to interesting problems. I'm constantly growing and improving my skills as a developer, and I always try to have some sort of side-project outside of work. I have experience in both backend and frontend web development. I've also built internal tools like user and license management systems, web scrapers, and monitoring tools.</strong>
